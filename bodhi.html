                <p>The Project:<br>For this project I was tasked with creating a solution that allowed health-conscious individuals to log in to a responsive health and wellbeing portal to not only record their health and medical information, but also access general physical and mental wellbeing features.</p>
                <p>The Purpose:<br>In today’s digital age, the resulting prolonged and unrelenting stressors that have come about from this “always on” lifestyle has left many individuals experiencing burnout and needing a way to stay on top of their health and wellness.</p>
                <p>The Problem:<br>The digital health tools that are currently available are rarely designed in a way that’s inclusive of users with varying needs, and fails to address the emotional, mental, and physical exhaustion that burnout brings about.</p>

          <h3>I. RESEARCH</h3>
          <p>Starting out, my goal was to understand the user. Before crafting a solution, I had to do some research to explore the problem space and uncover the wants, needs, and frustrations that users have with existing digital health tools. I conducted user research through the following methods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Competitive Analyses</li>
            <li>User Surveys</li>
            <li>User Interviews</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
              <p>I conducted competitive analyses on existing products on the market to familiarize myself with the problem space and identify elements of effective and ineffective UX in their apps, to uncover actionable information that I could use to improve my own designs.</p>

            <div>
              <h4>User Surveys</h4>
              <p>Next I surveyed 24 people regarding their usage with digital health tools and wellness habits. My reason for conducting the survey prior to user interviews was to collect data that would inform me of users’ wants, goals, and needs and potential points of frustration that I could then use as a basis for my interview questions, allowing for a deeper exploration of these findings.</p>

              <h4>User Interviews</h4>
              <p>To conclude my exploratory research, I conducted user interviews to build on the findings gathered from the surveys completed beforehand. My main objective for my interviews was to obtain useful feedback that I could use in the next steps of the design process to make informed decisions.</p>
              <p>After collecting and organizing the results from my interviews, I performed several rounds of sorting and mapping to create a visual map of the relationships within the data. Through this process, I identified different trends and themes in the results that were gathered and I synthesized insights based on these findings.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
              <p>The top insights I uncovered included:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users are more successful when they track their progress using digital health tools, because reports created by tracking features create a short-term sense of achievement for activities that require a long-term time commitment to see results.</li>
                <li>Tools that offer solutions and recommendations for healthy habits that can easily be done are most sought after and utilized by users because the activity and behaviors that they encourage are accessible and actionable.</li>
                <li>There is not an effective digital health tool on the market that allows users to access features and tools which aid them in improving both their mental and physical health, so many use multiple platforms to address their different mental and physical needs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The wants, needs, frustrations, behaviors, and attitudes that were revealed allowed for me to accomplish the goals I set forth for my exploratory user research by informing me about my product’s target audience, and as a result provided me with solid data from which I could use as a foundation for my designs.</p>

            <p>I created the user personas for Bodhi to capture the insights gathered from the research conducted in the previous steps. The creation of these deliverables allowed for me to paint a comprehensive picture of who I am designing for, helping keep the user at the forefront of my designs.</p>

            <p>Next I made user flows, basing these narrative documents off the behaviors, attitudes, and actions of my personas to ensure my design work is research driven and again ensure the user remains the focus of my design decisions moving forward.</p>
            <p>I created the user flows to define the steps the users would take to complete specific tasks using my app.</p>

            <p>These images show the initial user flows created at the beginning of the design process. As the product was further developed, and rounds of evaluative research were conducted, changes were made to these initial flows to reflect new discoveries and data.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <h4>Sitemap</h4>
            <p>After having a good grasp on my target audience and creating clearly defined user flows, I started crafting the structure for my product, creating the sitemap.</p>
            <p>Like the wireframes that are to follow, building the sitemap was also an iterative design process and different versions of these diagrams were created based on initial data, card sorting results, and after receiving feedback.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Building the Sitemap - Version 1</h5>
            <h6>Organizing Pages by Function</h6>
            <p>I created the first version of my sitemap guided by data that I learned from competitive research, organizing pages by function.</p><br><br>
            <h5>Validating the Sitemap</h5>
            <h6>Card Sorting Sessions</h6>
            <p>Next, to validate these decisions I made for navigation and pages, I used card sorting to see what groupings resonated with individuals from my target audience.</p><br>
            <h5>Updating the Sitemap - Version 2</h5>
            <h6>Analyzing Results and Regrouping Pages by Subject</h6>
            <p>After discovering that the majority of participants sorted pages by subject matter, I made changes to the sitemap to reflect this in the second versions, changing three of the top level navigation pages to "Mind," "Body," and “Connections."</p><br>
            <h5>Refining the Sitemap - Version 3</h5>
            <h6>Eliminating Unnecessary Interactions</h6>
            <p>Lastly one more version of the sitemap was created after receiving feedback about the mid-fidelity wireframes that were created with the previous sitemap. In this updated version, navigation was simplified.</p><br>

        <div class="container">
          <div>
            <h4>Wireframing & Prototyping</h4>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>RAPID PROTOTYPING & ITERATIVE DESIGNS</p>
            <p>I started to design the wireframes for my app using the personas, user flows, and sitemap as guides for my interfaces.</p><br><br>
            <p>LOW-FIDELITY<br>I began to build Bodhi by starting with low-fidelity wireframes to lay out the high-level functionality of my app. I purposely glossed over details like color, spacing, and imagery to keep the focus on showcasing the types of interactions I had in mind for my app.<br>↓</p><br>
            <p>MID-FIDELITY<br>I then used rapid prototyping to quickly build on these existing low-fidelity wireframes to show the future state of my application, with the focus being on the flows for my core features. I prototyped my mid-fidelity prototype, portraying more design detail and interactivity.<br>↓</p><br>
            <p>FEEDBACK<br>Before investing more time into crafting more detailed wireframes, I shared this prototype for review and used  feedback to then refine the design. Based on the feedback about my mid-fidelity designs, improvements were made to flows to lessen the amount of clicks it would take a user to get to their destination, thus simplifying navigation.<br>↓</p><br>
            <p>HIGH-FIDELITY<br>I then leveled up the design once more to create my high-fidelity prototype showing how the polished app would feel and function. I would then further develop my designs after subjecting the high-fidelity prototype to usability testing. The high- fidelity prototype at this stage in the process fleshed out the details of the design including graphics, spacing, and layout, but was still in gray-scale and purposely left out visual design elements since changes could still be made after conducting usability testing.</p><br>

            <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
            <p>With the first version of my high-fidelity prototype, I moved on to the testing phase. I conducted usability testing with real users from my target audience to uncover usability errors with the functionality of my core features.</p>
            <p>I constructed a test plan and test script, Recruited participants, and conducted 2 moderated in-person and 4 moderated remote testing sessions.</p>
            <p>I then organized and sorted the data, using affinity mapping and the rainbow spreadsheet. I utilized this process to help visualize the patterns in the collected data. It also provides a way to classify errors to be able to prioritize issues in my design that need to be addressed and improved.</p>

            <p>With the usability test data organized in the spreadsheet, I focused in on the major issues that needed to be addressed in my test report.</p>
            <p>The usability testing revealed the top challenges, issues, and errors experienced by participants included:</p><br>
            <p>ERRORS:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Participants had trouble finding the button to access, log, and store medical/health information.</li>
              <li>Participants had difficulty with locating or questioned the location of the tracking feature.</li>
              <li>Participants were confused about specificity of what was being tracked.</li>
              <li>It was hard for some participants to recognize the purpose and function of the homescreen elements (activity ring and calendar).</li>
              <li>When asked to navigate home, some participants could not initially recognize when they were on the home screen</li>

            <h5>Using Evidence to Suggest Changes</h5>
            <p>After Identifying the top 5 errors to be addressed in the next iteration of my prototype, I proposed the following changes to address these errors:</p><br>
            <p>FIXES:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Change the icon for medical information storage to a more familiar one that represents “Profile.”</li>
              <li>Move tracking feature to the homepage, where it will be more accessible.</li>
              <li>Add in “Select Exercise” option to clearly display to users the type of workout they are tracking.</li>
              <li>Add copy and edit graphics for these pages/elements for the activity ring and calendar to indicate the purpose of these elements from the initial home screen.</li>
              <li>Indicate location through highlighting the icon of the page the user is on.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>The suggested changes discussed in the results for the usability tests and preference tests were implemented in the design of the apps prototype. Following the creation of this new iteration, I moved onto the final steps of the process where I refined the design of my product.</p>

          <h3>VI. REFINING THE DESIGN</h3>
          <p>I created the structure of Bodhi by building an MVP for my product that I then evaluated with usability testing to validate my idea. After the successful completion of these phases, the next step I took in the design process was adding visual design.</p>
          <p>I refined the design for Bodhi by incorporating UI elements, adhering to common visual design principles and other UI guidelines. I then continued to improve the aesthetic and usability of Bodhi by making revisions based on feedback received from peers. These iteration processes allowed for the fine-tuning of Bodhi’s visual elements, which I then organized and detailed in my design documentation to reflect the polished UI for my app.</p>

          <p>Bodhi was the first design project that I created from scratch, taking on the role as the sole UX designer from end-to-end. In this process I learned a lot and grew immensely as a new designer. Prior to beginning the project I felt timid in my skills being a new designer, but after diving into this project and fully embracing the design thinking process, I now feel comfortable in my new skills and can confidently identify myself as a UX Designer having successfully created designs that I believe in and am extremely proud of.</p><br>
          <p>What I learned:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>At the beginning of the project it was challenging to not bring my own experiences and ideas into my designs, but after conducting both exploratory and evaluative research, I observed first hand the importance of staying neutral in order to let the findings that keep the user the focus of the designs at the forefront of all my decision making.</li>
            <li>I learned a lot about the iterative design process which demonstrated the importance of keeping an open mind and welcoming changes or new findings that may come about at any point.</li>
            <li>When in doubt, ask for feedback. Though at times it can be hard to get critiques about the work you have done, it is essential to have outside feedback - in welcoming feedback, whether good or bad, it ensures that designs can be validated or if errors exist, they can be improved or fixed. In this field a project is never truly finished, it is an ongoing process and I know that the best way to get as close to perfection is to always be open and listen to what others have to say to truly make the experience user friendly.</li>
