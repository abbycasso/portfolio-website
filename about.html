              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <h4 class="center">Hi, I’m Abby.<br>How’d I get here?</h4><br>
              <p>I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2015 with a bachelor’s degree in biology. I decided to major in biology because I have always had a strong interest in the natural world and other related topics. Equally as strong as my interest in the sciences, I have had an extreme passion for writing and other creative processes throughout my life. When I finished college, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. I started out working in sales but after about a year of feeling like I could be doing more for myself and others, I made a transition into the medical field where I worked as a Medical Assistant in Dermatology for about 4 years.</p>
              <p>It didn’t take long for me working as a medical assistant to realize I felt compelled to help people, and as a result I found fulfillment out of doing work that positively influenced others. In addition to this, I was able to utilize my problem-solving skills in my role. Though I was happy as a medical assistant, I felt that something was amiss and I didn’t see myself doing this kind of work long-term. It wasn’t until 2020 during the covid stay-at-home order when I gave serious thought to what I wanted to do with the rest of my life and truly dedicated time and effort into researching a career path that was right for me. It was during this time that I discovered the field of UX design, and in discovering this I found I could have a career that satisfied my want to help others, allowed for me to think critically and problem solve, and creatively express myself.</p>
              <p>In the summer of 2021, I finally decided to take an actionable step towards making a career as a UX Designer a reality when I enrolled in the CareerFoundry UX Design Course. In this project-based course, I learned and applied UX design principles, concepts, and skills in order to generate design deliverables and build a portfolio. I utilized the design thinking process and user-centered design to create a vocabulary learning app and a health and wellness mobile app. Throughout the course I gained proficiencies in UX design skills, UI design skills, and basic front-end development.</p>
              <p>Equipped with my previous experience, innate passions, and new UX design skillset, I’m excited to embark on this new journey in my career.</p>
